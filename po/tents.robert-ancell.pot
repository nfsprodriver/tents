"<p><i>Tents</i> is a puzzle game where you need to work out where all the "
"tents are in a field.</p><br/><p>The rules are:</p><ul><li>Each camper has "
"claimed a tree and placed their tent beside it (these campers like shade).</"
"li><li>The field is full - there is one tent for every tree.</li><li>No two "
"tents are beside each other, even diagonally (too noisy!).</li><li>The "
"number of tents in each row / column is shown with a number.</li></ul><p>You "
"can always work out where all the tents are with just these rules. Touching "
"a square allows you to mark it as grass (i.e. a tent cannot be here) or a "
"tent.</p><br/><p>Have fun!</p>"
